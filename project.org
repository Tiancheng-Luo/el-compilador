* Plan

* To Do

** Currently we don't handle special-variable-p in let bindings
   Major bug!

** Some special forms are still not handled

** signals need help

** If a value is ignored we still emit a temporary
   Sometimes a value is only needed as a boolean, like (if (and ...)).
   This could be optimized as well

** Quoting is totally mishandled

** Probably need more passes, pass infrastructure, SSA, type inference, etc

** Various code-gen bits need thinking through

* Emacs Bugs

** Some code uses the CLASS-child-p form, since the CLASS-p form didn't seem to work.

** There doesn't seem to be a way to fetch an object's name

** The *-list-p functions are generated but not documented

** defmethod's eldoc is messed up

** concat and mapconcat don't allow characters
   this seems unfriendly and pointless

** vc-dir "i" gives an unhelpful error if any other file is marked
   this seems somewhat useless

** it seems strange for elisp to have both defstruct and defclass
   given that it isn't really planning to be CL
