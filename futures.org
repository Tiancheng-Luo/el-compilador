* Futures

** Ideally, emacs would itself be written in emacs lisp

** This compiler can be used to bootstrap this process
   With type declarations and inferencing it can be as efficient
   as the C code

** It can also JIT compile parts as needed

** Type-generic operations like + would be better expressed
   using defgeneric and defmethod.  then the compiler could
   more easily optimize?  Not clear.

** It is bad that Emacs has 3 interpreters in it:
*** Emacs Lisp
*** Regexp
*** CCL
