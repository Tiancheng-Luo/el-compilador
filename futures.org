** Emacs should itself be written in emacs lisp

*** For every part this seems pretty hard!
*** But:

** This compiler can be used to bootstrap this process
   With type declarations and inferencing it can be as efficient
   as the C code

*** Plenty of examples, e.g. provide or copy-alist

** It can also JIT compile parts as needed

** Type-generic operations like + would be better expressed
   using defgeneric and defmethod.  then the compiler could
   more easily optimize?  Not clear.

** Meanwhile there should be a rule about use of Fwhatever in Emacs

*** Only "inlineable" uses should be permitted
*** Things like Fload should indirect via Ffuncall
*** This is very easy to do when translating from lisp

** It is bad that Emacs has 3 interpreters in it:
*** Emacs Lisp
*** Regexp
*** CCL
