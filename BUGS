can't compile widget-get from fns.el

C back end writes some bogus symbol names

C back end doesn't do out-of-ssa

================================================================

(elcomp--do '(defun elt (sequence n)
  (cl-check-type n integer)
  (if (listp sequence)
      (car (nthcdr n sequence))
    (aref sequence n))))

document the compilation / linkage model
